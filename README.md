Steps to make adding a branch and saving the changes done to file 

1. checkout -b <branch name> or checkout <branch name> (for existing branches)
2. add features in it or make changes to an existing branch
3. save the file (if not saved then git status will be in red color, meaning it has not been saved yet, if saving it will change to green)
4. then >> git add <filename>
5. git commit -m "message"
6. git push origin <branch name >
7. go to git hub check for pr , go to the branch for changes ,if popup not visible, then click on contrib and then create open pr                          and confirm pull request
